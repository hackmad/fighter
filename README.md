## Building

This project uses Cargo workspaces and split into 2 library and one binary:

__Notes:__
- A clean build will take a long time due to compilation of the entire
  `bevy` engine.
- The assets folder in the root of the project is symlinked into the
  `native` project.
- The assets folder needs to be copied to `native` and `browser/www` folders.
  It is ignored in `.gitignore` for this reason.

## game 

This is the shared library that houses the core game logic. It will be 
built as part of the other projects which target different runtimes.

## native

This compiles a native binary for the game.

```bash
cargo build -p native
```

To build release version:

```bash
cargo build -p native --release
```

## browser

This is for the WebAssembly game and uses [wasm-pack](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack).
It can't be build form the workspace root so you have to change to the
project folder first.

__NOTE:__ This relies on `Node 16.13.0 LTS`.

The following will build with `--release` by default:

```bash
cd browser
wasm-pack build --out-dir pkg
```

The following steps are for the first time setup only, 

Initialize the Node application:

```bash
npm init wasm-app www
```

Install dependencies for Node application:

```bash
cd www
npm install
```

Update `browser/www/package.json`:

```json
{
  // ..
  "scripts": {
    // ...
    "start": "cp -r ../../assets ./ && webpack-dev-server" // Update this line!
    // ...
  },
  // ...
  "devDependencies": {
    "browser": "file:../pkg", // Add this line!
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

Update `browser/www/index.js`:

```javascript
import * as wasm from "browser";
wasm.run()
```

Install dependencies again:

```bash
cd www
npm install
```

## Running

## native

```bash
cp -r assets native/assets
cargo run -p native
```

## browser

```bash
cd browser/www
npm run start
```

If you are using a newer verison of Node, then you might need to add
`NODE_OPTIONS` like this:

```bash
cd browser/www
NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider npm run start
```

Open the browser to the [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)

__NOTES:__

By default browsers block autoplay and so there might be no sound. 

Firefox: 
- Under `Tools` menu click `Page Info`.
- Click `Permissions` tab.
- Under `Autoplay` uncheck `Use Default`
- Check `Allow Audio and Video`.

Safari:
- Go to `Preferences`.
- Click `Websites` tab.
- On the left side click `Auto-Play`
- Enable `Allow All Auto-Play` for `localhost`.

Chrome:
- Go to `Settings`.
- On the left select `Privacy and security`.
- Scroll down to `Additional content settings`.
- Click `Sounds`
- Under `Allowed to play sound` add `localhost`.
